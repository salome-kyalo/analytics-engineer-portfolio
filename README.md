# 📊 Telco Customer Churn — End-to-End Analytics Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end analytics workflow to analyze customer churn behavior in a telecommunications dataset.

The goal is to:
- Clean and validate raw customer data
- Engineer revenue and engagement features
- Explore churn behavior patterns
- Prepare data for predictive modeling

This project simulates a real-world analytics engineering workflow.

## 🔍 Key Engineering Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values
- Validated churn label integrity
- Checked feature consistency

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Revenue Per Month
- High Value Customer flag
- Engagement Score (service usage count)

### 3️⃣ Analytical Insights
- Churned customers show higher revenue concentration
- Engagement score has weak negative correlation with churn
- Revenue positively correlates with churn likelihood

## 📈 Example Engineered Features

- `Revenue Per Month = Total Revenue / Tenure`
- `Engagement Score = Count of subscribed services`
- Binary `High Value Customer` classification

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Convert notebook into production-ready Python script
- Add modeling (Logistic Regression / XGBoost)
- Containerize pipeline
- Add CI/CD workflow
